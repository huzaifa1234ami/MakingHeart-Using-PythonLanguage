# Heart Shape Animation with Turtle Graphics  

This project uses the Turtle graphics library in Python to create an animated heart shape. The heart is generated by plotting points calculated from mathematical equations and is drawn dynamically for a captivating effect.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Mathematical Equations**:  
   The heart's shape is defined by two parametric equations:  
   - `hearta(k)`: Controls the y-coordinate using the sine function.  
   - `heartb(k)`: Controls the x-coordinate using a combination of cosine functions.  

   These equations create the smooth curves that form the heart shape.

2. **Turtle Graphics**:  
   The Turtle library is used to plot the calculated points on the screen, rendering the heart curve step by step.  

3. **Animation**:  
   - The program loops through the calculated points (up to 6000 iterations).  
   - Each point is plotted, and the turtle returns to the center to give a dynamic, glowing effect.  
   - The heart shape is colored with a custom shade (`#f73487`), creating a vibrant visual display.

## **Features**  

- **Mathematical Visualization**: Combines trigonometry and programming to create an elegant heart shape.  
- **Custom Colors**: The heart is rendered with a vivid pink color for a striking appearance.  
- **Animation**: The heart is drawn dynamically, giving it a unique, animated effect.
